Problem: Once the pilatus detector has error, It's always being displayed
on the buttom of the system status bar even detector works normally. 

Solution: add $dcss sendMessage "htos_operation_completed detector_stop 1.5 normal" in 
 if { $returnStatus == "OK" } {
            switch $returnCode {
                7 {

		$dcss sendMessage "htos_operation_completed detector_stop 1.5 normal"
		  }

to make sure it send the "detector_stop" normal message to DCS once the detectorstop normally. This is because this is tight to the following code in dcss/scripts/engine/message_handlers.tcl

    if {$operationName == "detector_stop" && [isString detector_status]} {
        variable ::nScripts::detector_status
        if {$status == "normal"} {
            set display Ready
        } else {
            set display Error
        }

        set detector_status "Detector $display"
    }

In order to change from "error" to "ready" the detector_stop set to "normal"
is needed.
