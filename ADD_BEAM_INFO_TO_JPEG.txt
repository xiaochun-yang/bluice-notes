error messsage: during screening process

error server screening videoSnapshot with beam info error: Exception in thread  main  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: url

solution to get rid of this message

set ADD_BEAM_INFO_TO_JPEG 0 

at file SequenceDevice.tcl under the ../dcss/scrips/operation

somehow I don't get the beam info at the same place as SSRF. 
need to dig out further if this info needed in the future.
