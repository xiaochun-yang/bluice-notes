When a dark current will be taken by the following code.

 //check to see if user requested to reuse last good dark image
 if ( !reuseDark )
 {
       // check to see if dark image has expired or if the exposure time has changed too much.
       if ( ( time(0) - mDark[ frame.runIndex ].creationTime > mDarkRefreshTime ) ||
         ( fabs( frame.exposureTime / mDark[frame.runIndex].exposureTime - 1.0 ) > mDarkExposureTolerance ) )
       {
              // collect a new dark image
              mDark[frame.runIndex].isValid = FALSE;
        }
 }
( from dhs_Quantum4.cc)


mDarkExposureTolerance is defined in the Config file (0.1 at X4A.config)

Need to find out the meaning of the following parameters. 

frame.exposureTime			Assume this is the new time
mDark[frame.runIndex].exposureTime      Assume this is the old time

if change from 10 seconds to 11 seconds
fabs( frame.exposureTime / mDark[frame.runIndex].exposureTime - 1.0 ) = 0.09
it's less 0.1 (for X4A case). It will not collect dark current. of course, it will
have to satisfy the other part of it.


Above routine will not collect dark current every time even the "use last
dark" is not checked. if you want to collect dark on every time when the "use
last dark" is unchecked, Then the above code is needed to simply change to as
the following

if ( !reuseDark )
 {
      // collect a new dark image
      mDark[frame.runIndex].isValid = FALSE;
 }
