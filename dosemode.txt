i0 is used (hard coded in the dcss/scripts/operations/normalize.tcl) for
the purpose of normalization of the xray-beam. 

i2 is located at right after  the exposure shutter (no beam when shutter close).
i1 is located at right before the exposure shutter (have beam even shutter close).
i0 is located at right before the 2nd shutter.

They are all read from galil controller. 

In *.dat, there two parameters related to the does as the following

The DoseModeControl.tcl in ../BluIceWidgets is for this.

change -state from disable to normal to get dose mode can be clicked.
itk_component add doseEnable {
                        DCS::Checkbutton $ring.inv -text "Enable" -state
normal
                } {}


normalize.tcl

proc getStableIonCounts is to read ion chamber value.

proc normalize_start {} {
    variable dose_data

    set counts [getStableIonCounts TRUE]

    if { $counts == 0} {
        return "Normalize Failed"
    }

    set situation [lindex $dose_data 2]
    set dose_data [lreplace $dose_data 0 1 $situation $counts]

    log_note "Beam Normalized with $counts counts."

    return "normalized"
}
