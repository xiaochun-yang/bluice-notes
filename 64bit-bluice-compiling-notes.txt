cbflib compiling

1) go to CBFlib-0.8.1 dir
2) copy Makefile Makefile_LINUX_64 Makefile
3) make clean
4) make install
5) go back to cbflib and then go to lib
6) mkdir linux64
7) cd linux64
8) cp CBFlib-0.8.1/lib/*.a .

img1.2.4 compiling

(1) put #define USE_COMPOSITELESS_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK at begining of

imgUtil.c
imgUtil.h
imgUtil.c
imgUtil.c
imgBMP.c
imgGIF.c
imgJPEG.c
imgPNG.c
imgPS.c
imgWindow.c
imgXBM.c
imgXPM.c

or I could do the following (get from the web)

the Tk folks have changed the Tk_PhotoPutBlock interface in 8.4.x.
to fix this, you have to add a TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY parameter
to all three Tk_PhotoPutBlock calls in tkImaging.c.


to make it work under older versions as well, change all
    Tk_PhotoPutBlock(...);
calls to

    Tk_PhotoPutBlock(...
#if (TK_MAJOR_VERSION == 8 && TK_MINOR_VERSION >= 4 || TK_MAJOR_VERSION > 8)
        , TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY
#endif
    );

(untested)

(2) download "tcllib-1.11.1-4.fc15.noarch.rpm" and install it.
It include MIME 1.5.4 libarary package

alternatively (but also untested), you can add a
#define USE_COMPOSITELESS_PHOTO_PUT_BLOCK
to the top of the file (before including the Tcl and Tk libraries)

(3) compiling release-5_1/dhs in files src/safeFile.cc
change nextSlash = strstr( searchDirectory,"/");
to  nextSlash = strstr( (char *)searchDirectory,"/");

or redefine searchDirectory to char * not const char *

(4) setenv EPICS_HOST_ARCH linux-x86_64

(5) In impdhs change file src/AutochoochThread.cxx

char* str =  strchr(m_pMsg->GetOperationArgument(), '{');
to
char* str = (char*) strchr(m_pMsg->GetOperationArgument(), '{');
 src/AutochoochThread.cxx

src/FileAccessThread.cxx:508
from char* str = strrchr( pArgs, '{');
to   char* str = (char*) strrchr( pArgs, '{');

(7) when install ifort (intel fortran compiler), it will
tells you that there's missing glib ... for 32 bits and
your system is not supported. Just ignore all of it and
go ahead to install the package.

(8)  /etc/xinetd.d/imperson is set as following (it should change to /usr/local/dcs
when dcs is installed in the root)

 service imperson
{
        type            =UNLISTED
        socket_type     =stream
        protocol        =tcp
        wait            =no
        user            =root
        server          =/usr/local/sbin/imperson.d
        server_args     =host=localhost port=8080 securePort=8443 appName=SMBTest caFile=/home/yangx/release-5_1/dcsconfig/data/X4A.crt
        port            =61001
        disable         =no
}

(8) Download the new tcl_clibs from repository and recompile it. The old one from dkong yangx
doesn't work with 64 bits somehow. It gives the following messages in the dcss log file

couldn't load file "../../tcl_clibs/linux64/tcl_clibs.so": ../../tcl_clibs/linux64/tcl_clibs.so: undefined symbol: _ZL20PGM16Format_fileReadP10Tcl_InterpP12Tcl_Channel_PKcP7Tcl_ObjPviiiiii     while executing "load $DCS_DIR/tcl_clibs/$MACHINE/tcl_clibs.so dcs_c_library"     (file "../scripts/engine/scriptingEngine.tcl" line 169) {TCL_LOG  }

(9) ******* It's important. I installed tkimg1.4. It always have segment fault error when 
run ./bluice.tcl X4A. I checked the process. The eror occurs when it runs the
line code "$m_rawImage configure -data $_imageData" at Video.tcl. The video
image on the cameras could never displayed in the bluice gui. I could not
figoured out what's going on. Finally I removed tkimg1.4. Then everything
works. I checked Img lib. there's /usr/lib/Img1.2 still in there. (the one I
removed was in /usr/lib64/tcl8.5/Img1.4). 

The conclusion is the Img used in the bluice is not tkimg.
