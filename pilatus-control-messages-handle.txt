there are following messages from detector server which handled by pilatusDHS

1) N images set to %d

2) Frames per image set to %d

3) imag %d

4) Exposure time set to: %d

5) Starting %f second background (non triggering images)

6) Starting externally triggered exposurer(s)

Need to study all the cases 


also where to update the status (see collectShutterless.tcl) so that will change the
status from "Detector error" to "Detector normal".

Need to set update in the detector server as well.
