to use encoder as a counter for single channel analyzer with the flurence detector.

The following modifications are made in the madScan.tcl under dcss/scripts/operations

Original code as the following

        for {set tryingTimes 0} {$tryingTimes < 3} {incr tryingTimes} {
		.......
		.......
            set opHandle [start_waitable_operation excitationScan $startEnergy $endEnergy 1 $referenceDetector $scanTime_]
            set result [wait_for_operation $opHandle]
		.........
		.........	
        }


Here add 

set madscan 0  (for single channel)
or
set madscan 1  (for muliti-channels)

        for {set tryingTimes 0} {$tryingTimes < 3} {incr tryingTimes} {
                .......
                .......
		if {madscan} {
            		set opHandle [start_waitable_operation excitationScan $startEnergy $endEnergy 1 $referenceDetector $scanTime_]
            		set result [wait_for_operation $opHandle]
		} else {
			#put single channel statement here.
                	if {$referenceDetector != ""} {
                        	#start the real time clock
                                read_ion_chambers $scanTime $referenceDetector
                                wait_for_devices $referenceDetector
                                set referenceCounts [get_ion_chamber_counts $referenceDetector]
                	} else {
                        	set referenceCounts 0
                	}
			set deadTimeRatio 0
			set signalCounts [get_counter 

		}
                .........
                .........
        }
