here is what I did for runing bluice in different account in the same machine.
new account nesg
old account nysbc

1) edit file SimpleUserDB.xml in /usr/local/dcs/apache-tomcat-5.5.20/webapps/gateway/WEB-INF/
	add user "nesg" and set password

2) copy .cshrc file from nysbc and also starttomcat, shuttomcat startdcs stopdcs and startbluice

3) go to /tmp (become super) cheange all bluice lock files to group accessible.

4) go to /usr/local/dcs/xos/src edit file xos.c

change statbuf.st_uid != geteuid( )
to     statbuf.st_gid != getegid( )

this will prevent checking user ids (it will always get errors if checking for different users
because each user has unique ids). 

This part need to be reserched further. should talk to Shanghai and SSRL and see how they
handled this problem.

Once this is being changed. It need to recompile entire bluice files not only for the dir
.../xos it should be executed in /usr/local/dcs/batchfile 
make clean uninstall
make

Otherwise it will not work because many files in the bluice linked to xos files already.

5) go to /usr/local/dcs/X4A change *.dat file mode to be able to access by all the users
I simplely use chmod 777 for all the *.dat file here. 

Once 1) to 5) are done. It's ready to run the bluice in the new account.
