the delay time I added on in the robot operation.

1.  in ../dcss/scripts/operations/SampleMountingDevice.itcl

SampleMountingDevice::mountNextCrystal
500 ms between dismount and mount

        #dismount first
        set result [dismountCrystal $cassette $row $column]
 
        #wait for 500 ms before mount
        after 500  
  
        #Then mount
        set result [mountCrystal $cassette_nxt $row_nxt $column_nxt 0]

2. in dismount function

	set operationHandle [eval start_waitable_operation set_sample_address $argument]
        set result [wait_for_operation_to_finish $operationHandle]

        set argument "$cassette $row $column"
        set operationHandle [eval start_waitable_operation dismount_crystal $cassette $row $column]
        set result [wait_for_operation_to_finish $operationHandle]

3. In mount function

             set argument "$column$row"
             set operationHandle [eval start_waitable_operation set_sample_address $argument]
             set result [wait_for_operation_to_finish $operationHandle]

             set argument "$cassette $row $column"
             set operationHandle [eval start_waitable_operation mount_crystal $argument]
             set result [wait_for_operation_to_finish $operationHandle]

4.in vb robot program

500 ms at set_sample_address

500 ms at mount_crystal

200 ms at dismount_crystal

Should change dismount to 500 and mount to 200.

5. So from dismount to mount there will be about 500ms + 200ms + 500ms + 500ms
+ 500ms = 2.2 sec. That's too long. Need to shorten this.
