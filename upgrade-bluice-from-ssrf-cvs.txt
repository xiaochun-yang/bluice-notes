Upgrade bluice from ssrl cvs server

1. go to release-5_1/batchbuild
2. execute "gmake co"  to update files
   the updated files should be like the following

U BluIceWidgets/Anneal.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/BeamSize.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/BeamlineVideo.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/BluIce.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/CollectView.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/Collimator.tcl

save the names of all the updated files to a file in case needed later. 


3  the update process stoped at the following points

a) Had following error 
	cvs checkout: Updating newmat10/tar
	? xform/xform.c
	? xform/xform.h
	cvs checkout: Updating xform
	cvs checkout: move away xform/xform.c; it is in the way
	C xform/xform.c
	cvs checkout: move away xform/xform.h; it is in the way
	C xform/xform.h
	gmake: *** [co_xform] Error 1


 	U dcss/src/dcss_ssl.c
	cvs checkout: Updating dcss/tmp
	gmake: *** [co_dcss] Error 1

here is what I did.
	1. go to xform dir and change xform.c xform.h to xform.c-good and
		xform.h-good
	gmake co

	this will upgrade all the following modules
		xos \
                logging \
                xos_cpp \
                http_cpp \
                auth \
                auth_client \
                jpegsoc \
                cbf \
                diffimage \
                newmat10 \
                xform \
                tcl_clibs \
                dcsconfig \
                dcsmsg \
                dali \
                dcs_tcl_packages \
                java_dcss_sim \
                DcsWidgets
		imperson_cpp \
                dcss \

	2. I cvs the dcss manually as the following, It seems working. Have no idea
	 what's wrong.
	[yangx@yangx ~/release-5_1]$ cvs -d :pserver:ogata@smb.slac.stanford.
	edu:/home/code/repository co -A dhs (execute it in release-5_1 dir)
	
	repeat above command on the following module
                epicsgw 
		imgsrv 
                autochooch 
                impdhs 
                blu-ice
                BluIceWidgets 
                simdhs 
                simdetector
 
	In fact, I can update everyone of the modules manually.

4. build bulice --- in batchbuild do the following
	gmake

	it has a error when build dcss. It's could not find /usr/bin/ld -litcl
	I made following changes in the makefile under linux in the dcss dir.

	change STD_LIBS += -ltk -ltcl -litcl
	to     STD_LIBS += -ltk -ltcl /usr/lib/itcl3.3/libitcl3.3.so

	Then it's ok to build entire bluice.

5. The following scripts file has been changed during the upgrade. It include
	<<<<<<  and ==== symbals in the program and need to manually delete or
	comment out.

C dcss/scripts/engine/timerService.tcl
C dcss/scripts/operations/SampleMountingDevice.itcl
C dcss/scripts/operations/SequenceDevice.tcl
C dcss/scripts/operations/centerLoop.tcl

C BluIceWidgets/BluIce.tcl
C BluIceWidgets/HutchView.tcl
C BluIceWidgets/SamplePositionWidget.tcl
C BluIceWidgets/StatusBar.tcl
C DcsWidgets/Video.tcl
C DcsWidgets/DcsProtocol.tcl
C dcsconfig/data/default.config

some changes are made in these files.

In StatusBar.tcl 

#yangx    if {$m_ctsState != "Beams"} {
#        $itk_component(ll) configure \
        -text "Spear $m_ctsState:" \
        -foreground red
#        return
#    }

    if {$m_ctsState != "Beams"} {
        $itk_component(ll) configure \
        -text "Ring Current:" \
        -foreground red
        return
    }
