Upgrade bluice from ssrl cvs server

1. go to release-5_1/batchbuild
2. execute "gmake co"  to update files
   the updated files should be like the following

U BluIceWidgets/Anneal.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/BeamSize.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/BeamlineVideo.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/BluIce.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/CollectView.tcl
U BluIceWidgets/Collimator.tcl

save the names of all the updated files to a file in case needed later. 


3  the update process stoped at the following points

a) Had following error 
	cvs checkout: Updating newmat10/tar
	? xform/xform.c
	? xform/xform.h
	cvs checkout: Updating xform
	cvs checkout: move away xform/xform.c; it is in the way
	C xform/xform.c
	cvs checkout: move away xform/xform.h; it is in the way
	C xform/xform.h
	gmake: *** [co_xform] Error 1


 	U dcss/src/dcss_ssl.c
	cvs checkout: Updating dcss/tmp
	gmake: *** [co_dcss] Error 1

here is what I did.
	1. go to xform dir and change xform.c xform.h to xform.c-good and
		xform.h-good
	gmake co

	this will upgrade all the following modules
		xos \
                logging \
                xos_cpp \
                http_cpp \
                auth \
                auth_client \
                jpegsoc \
                cbf \
                diffimage \
                newmat10 \
                xform \
                tcl_clibs \
                dcsconfig \
                dcsmsg \
                dali \
                dcs_tcl_packages \
                java_dcss_sim \
                DcsWidgets
		imperson_cpp \
                dcss \

	2. I cvs the dcss manually as the following, It seems working. Have no idea
	 what's wrong.
	[yangx@yangx ~/release-5_1]$ cvs -d :pserver:ogata@smb.slac.stanford.
	edu:/home/code/repository co -A dhs (execute it in release-5_1 dir)
	
	repeat above command on the following module
                epicsgw 
		imgsrv 
                autochooch 
                impdhs 
                blu-ice
                BluIceWidgets 
                simdhs 
                simdetector
 
	In fact, I can update everyone of the modules manually.

4. build bulice --- in batchbuild do the following

	should first do 
	gmake clear uninstall
	to get rid of the old *.o files then do the following

	gmake

	it has a error when build dcss. It's could not find /usr/bin/ld -litcl
	I made following changes in the makefile in the dcss dir.

	change STD_LIBS += -ltk -ltcl -litcl
	to     STD_LIBS += -ltk -ltcl /usr/lib/itcl3.3/libitcl3.3.so

	Then it's ok to build entire bluice.

5. The following scripts file has been changed during the upgrade. It include
	<<<<<<  and ==== symbals in the program and need to manually delete or
	comment out.

C dcss/scripts/engine/timerService.tcl
C dcss/scripts/operations/SampleMountingDevice.itcl
C dcss/scripts/operations/SequenceDevice.tcl
C dcss/scripts/operations/centerLoop.tcl

C BluIceWidgets/BluIce.tcl
C BluIceWidgets/HutchView.tcl
C BluIceWidgets/SamplePositionWidget.tcl
C BluIceWidgets/StatusBar.tcl
C DcsWidgets/Video.tcl
C DcsWidgets/DcsProtocol.tcl
C dcsconfig/data/default.config

some changes are made in these files.

In StatusBar.tcl 

#yangx    if {$m_ctsState != "Beams"} {
#        $itk_component(ll) configure \
        -text "Spear $m_ctsState:" \
        -foreground red
#        return
#    }

    if {$m_ctsState != "Beams"} {
        $itk_component(ll) configure \
        -text "Ring Current:" \
        -foreground red
        return
    }

6. There's missing code in the dhs/src/dhs_Quantum4.cc file. Adding the
   following if it's missing.

                        if ( messageID == DHS_MESSAGE_STRING_POLL )
                        {
                                xos_semaphore_post( semaphore );
                                continue;
                        }


	
7 In the file ../dcss/scripts/operations/collect_procedures.tcl
  and collectShutterless.tcl

I have to comment of the following lines

          #  if {$needSaveSystemSnapshot} {
          #      set snapshotPath [file join $directoryNew $filename.txt]
          #      saveSystemSnapshot $userName $sessionID $snapshotPath
          #  }

the function "saveSystemSnapshot" will updated the encoders and ionchambers.
The data collect will alway stuck here. Need to be revisit here again once
the beam is back. 

(8). Add the following in the file dhs_dmc2180.cc in the (somehow the upgrade
erased some of the changes i made before)

		 if (messageID == DHS_MESSAGE_ION_CHAMBER)

//yang add
                                // parse_ion_message(message);
                                /* signal calling thread */
                                char commandToken[200];
                                float i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6,i7;
                                sscanf( ((const char*) message),"%s %f %f %f
%f %f %f %f %f",commandToken,&i0,&i1,&i2,&i3,&i4,&i5,&i6,&i7);
                                // sprintf(htos_message,
                                // "htos_report_ion_chambers %f i0 %f i1 %f i2
                                // %f e_lvdt_m1_ubend %f e_lvdt_m1_dbend
                                // %f",tm,i0,i1,i2,i3,i4);
                                sprintf(htos_message,
"htos_set_string_completed analogInStatus1 normal %f %f %f %f %f %f %f
%f",i0,i1,i2,i3,i4,i5,i6,i7);
                                // LOG_INFO1("yang_ion : %s ",htos_message); 

(9). In the galil script file in the dhs 
for the oscillation part. My CB is shutter open and SB is shutter close. (ssrl
SB is shutter open and CB is shutter close. In script_x4a_galil1-new.txt, I
add changed all CB to SB and SB to CB for x4a case. Also I add CB 1 at
begaining of Expose and make sure that the 2nd shutter (in channel 1) is open
for the exposure.

At NoExpose routine. The ShutCh is set to 0 which is none exist so that SB CB 
won't do anything. But somehow SB(CB) 0 will invoke SB(CB) 1. it's
really strange. Called galil. It confirmed that 0 as default same as 1. That's
the way they designed even though it doesn't make any sense at all. Now I am 
using 17 as defaul after test 1-16 channels. changed the following code in the
dhs_dmc2180.cc 

        if ( exposeCmd.useShutter == TRUE ) {
                Dmc2180_shutter * shutter;
                shutter = (Dmc2180_shutter * ) dhs_database_get_volatile_data(
exposeCmd.shutterDeviceIndex );
                exposeCmd.shutterChannel = shutter->channel;
        } else {
                exposeCmd.shutterChannel = 17;
        }
