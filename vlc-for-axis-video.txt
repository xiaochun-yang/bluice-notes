to save axis video recording

the new firefox and chrome using html5 protocal. It doesn't support axis video recording (too new for axis server)

The way to record the axis video is to use VLC software to record it.

1) install alc on linux

2) click on media to open a network stream

3) set: rtsp://10.19.2.91:554/axis-media/media.amp?camera=1/2/3/4/quad  make sure all small cases letter

(1 is the video 1 .......)

4) login to the video sever
