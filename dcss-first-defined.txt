The dcss is first defined in the bluice.tcl file
it defined as 

DCS::DcssUserProtocol dcss $dcssHostName $dcssPort \
                 -useSSL [::config getDcssUseSSL] \
                 -authProtocol $authProtocol \
                 -_reconnectTime 1000 \
                 -callback "" \
                 -networkErrorCallback ""

So dcss is a object of the class of DCS::DcssUserProtocol


It's being used as ::dcss and dcss later on used in the other files

DCS::DcssUserProtocol is the name of a class. It can be written like "DCSDcssUserProtocol". The "::" in between is just letter any letters. It makes people think it represent a special meaning because class function usually written like "classname::functionname" It's kind of confusing the way the class name is written.
