screening-web-spreadsheet

problem:

when click on -screeningtab--->Web---->Spreadsheet

It gose to the browser and had a bad link as follows

http:// dkonk:8080/crystals/CassetteList.html?SMBSessionID=F852BC3770DFE26353A8FBC995303A90&userName=nysbc

If I go direct to the web for the crystal sever. It works and the link as
follows

https://dkong:8443/crystals/CassetteInfo.jsp?accessID=E0E2B1907A7CB49E22C4F6B306335680&userName=nysbc

Solution: Commented out 2. and uncomment 1 (before 1 is commented out and 2 is
uncommented)

1. screening.cassetteInfoUrl=https://localhost:8443/crystals/CassetteInfo.jsp
2. #screening.cassetteInfoUrl=http://localhost:8080/crystals/CassetteList.html

Now it works.
