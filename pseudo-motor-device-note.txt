A important thing need to be pay attention in writing a device for
a sudo motor is that the function name can't be the same.

For example:

In sample_x.tcl

proc tripot_1_calculate_x { x z y } {

    return [expr ($z - $y*11.1125/97 - $x*19.225/97)]
}

In sample_y.tcl

proc tripot_1_calculate_y { y x z } {

    return [expr ($z - $y*11.1125/97 - $x*19.225/97)]
}

You either don't define  tripot_1_calculate in the sample_y.tcl or
use different name like "tripot_1_calculate_y". If same name used,
tcl will be confused. 


Another undocumented feature for pseudo motor is in the configuration as follow in dat file

bending_center
2
self bending_center
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0
0.150000 10.000000 0.095000 0 0 0 0 mm
bend_x3 bend_x5

line 6 is used when you click configure in the staff tab
to configure the indiivdule motion. "0" means don't show
the real motor. "1" means show the real motors
