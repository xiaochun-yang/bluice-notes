1) Changed Makefile for handelSrc which will be good for both saturn and mercury. 
take out the -DEXCLUDE_MERCURY and add -DEXCLUDE_STJ
STJ is not being used in both saturn and mercury.

2)changed function name "info" to "myinfo" in the file logger.c and logger.h. This is due to
confilict with "info" defined in the file xerxes.c of the handelSrc. It causes compiling error.

3)Need to change mode 777 for /dev/bus/usb. Otherwise it can't be run from the user "nysbc".
The default mode can only be accessed by the root. Need a way to change this automatically.
