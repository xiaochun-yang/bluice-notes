gDevice originally defined in "hardware_commands.tcl" (I could only find it's not
defined as global)

gDevice is a array varible.

set gDevice(all_motors_blocked) $operationID


It look little confused in the following form
set gDevice($motor,lockOn) $value
set gDevice($motor,upperLimitOn) $value

here "$motor,lockOn" look like two keys. But actually it's one key. there's
no space seperate the "," (it's kind of tricky). For example if $motor is phi,
the key will be look like "phi,lockOn" it's still a one key.
