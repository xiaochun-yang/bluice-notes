The purpose for this part of codes is to add a warm up grabber feature
in the screening mode so that people can set after how many mount/dismount 
the robot should warm up the grabber in case it collects too much ice.

(1) The follwoing varaible and function are added in the file SequenceDevice.tcl

private variable m_startWarmUp 0
private variable m_wcycle 0

::itcl::body SequenceDevice::doGrabberWarmCycle { cycle } {

        set m_wcycle [expr $m_wcycle + 1]
        if { $m_wcycle >= $cycle } {
                #start_operation warm_up_grabber
                puts "yangx Warming cycle start"
                set m_startWarmUp 1
                #reset the wcycle to 0
                set m_wcycle 0
        }
}

Add the foloowing in the function "SequenceDevice::mountCrystal"
            #yangx warm_up grabber
            if { $m_startWarmUp } {
                start_operation warm_up_grabber
                set m_startWarmUp 0
            }

 set m_wcycle 0
It's very impartant here that the warm_up_grabber executed in the
MountNextCrystal process not in the doGrabberWarmCycle(). This way
it ensure that the grabber is warmed right after the sample is mounted.
And also In the Mount NextCrystal, it will wait warm_up_grabber finish,
and then execute the next operation. 

(2) In BluiceWidgets/sequenceActions.tcl, add the following

16 "Warm Grabber Cycle    " 1 1 0 16 16 {5}  

private method getGrabberWarmCycleParameters
private method setGrabberWarmCycleParameters
private method createGrabberWarmCycleParametersn

(3) In file ScreeningTask.tcl
 "Grabber Warm Cycle "
