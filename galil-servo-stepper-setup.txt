galil servo and stepper setup

(1) Change stepper to servo (hardware)

there's a jumper on the DMC-2183 board. jumper on is stepper, out is servo


(2) user ether smaterTerm or Galiltool to set the following 

	MTE =-1	servo reverse polarity  E---current phi axis
	CEE =2	servo reverse quadratum 
	ERE =-1	igore the difference between encoder and errors
	OEE =0	disable off-on-error

	useful commands
	SH	servo on 
	MO	power off



(3)  Use AMC Driversuite to setup servo motor

	a) connect to the servo motor with RS232 cable to a computer with AMC software
	b) run the AMC software and click on "Connect" (RS2323)
	c) Disable "command profiler"
		   "Position loop"
	   Enable  "Velocity loop"

	d) In the "current loop", set proportional gain to 0
	e) In the "velocity loop",set proportional gain to 0.017
	f) In config  Max 10V. set 1V = 3RPM (Max speed 30 RPM). Analog input is 1



Change to stepper from servo

(1)  Enable "position loop"
(1)  Click on "Command Source" --> set to "step and direction" then click on 
     the button --> set input counts to 1 and position counts to 1.

(2)  Enable "position loop"

(3)   				position Loop 	velocity Loop 	Current Loop

	Proportional gain	300.0552	0.20068		40.0879
	Integral gain		0.06257		0.0129		2.8189
	derivative gain		2809.1893	0.2231
	V.F			0		0
	A.F.			0		All Pass

(3)	OEE =0	disable on-off-error
	KI=0 KP=6 KD=64
	CEE = 4 or 6
	MTE = -2
	SH
	BN

	somehow when it's change from servo to step. the motor is always being
turned off whenever bluice is restarted. I have to do sh to turn it on
manually. I did SH and then BN from the startterm. then it become ok.  
	

(4) Use the Galiltool software to get the correct PID
The following is from chuck's email about how to enable the software

"  I have that Design Kit, but I have not found it very useful.  You can
probably invoke it by clicking on the tuning button.  It will tell you to
upgrade the software.  If it asks for a passwork try "start".  Again,
however, I do not find it very useful."

I found the software is very useful anyway. The parameters are determined
by the software are the right parameters.
