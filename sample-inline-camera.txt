Camera setting: inline --- upper camera
		direct --- lower camera low mag and high mag


Program change:
1)  dcss/scripts/operation/inlineMoveSample.tcl

Changed        
	 move sample_x by $dx
        wait_for_devices sample_x
        move sample_y by $dy
        wait_for_devices sample_y
        move sample_z by $dz
        wait_for_devices sample_z
    } else {
        move sample_x by $dx
        move sample_y by $dy
        move sample_z by $dz

to  
        move sample_x by -$dx
        wait_for_devices sample_x
        move sample_y by -$dy
        wait_for_devices sample_y
        move sample_z by -$dz
        wait_for_devices sample_z
    } else {
        move sample_x by -$dx
        move sample_y by -$dy
        move sample_z by -$dz

So that sample_x sample_y and sample_z can move to the right same direction.

2) /BluiceWidget/SampleMotorView.tcl

Changed 
	itk_component add video {
            SamplePositioningWidget $itk_interior.video \
            [::config getImageUrl 1] \
            sample_sample_camera_constant sample_camera_zoom centerLoop inlineMoveSample \
             -beamWidthWidget ::device::$gMotorBeamWidth \
             -beamHeightWidget ::device::$gMotorBeamHeight
                } {
                        keep -videoParameters -videoEnabled
                }

to 
	itk_component add video {
            SamplePositioningWidget $itk_interior.video \
            [::config getImageUrl 1] \
            sample_sample_camera_constant sample_camera_zoom centerLoop moveSample \
             -beamWidthWidget ::device::$gMotorBeamWidth \
             -beamHeightWidget ::device::$gMotorBeamHeight
                } {
                        keep -videoParameters -videoEnabled
                }

This change will make "sample motor view" in the staff->develop tool agree with the Hutch view.
