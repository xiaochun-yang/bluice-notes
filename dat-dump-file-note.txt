Problem: I add bending and bender_center in the X4A.dump and then did the 
	following:
	(1) ./dcss X4A -r ../../dcsconfig/data/X4A.dump
	(2) ./dcss X4A -s 

	then launched bluice (3) /bluice.tcl X4A

	to my surprised. I could not find these new motions bending and
	bend_center. (in staff tab, looking for all the motions and motors)

	However, when I use X4A.dat and repeat above. It works. I can see
	bending and bend_center. 

	More strangely, when I change the gonio_phi position value in the 
	X4A.dump file and repeat the (1) (2) (3). Bluice displays the new
	value. somehow it take the new value from the dump file. It can't
	add new values, but it can update new values. 

Why?   

Conclusion: Use X4A.dat to add or get rid of items (copy X4A.dump to X4A.dat
	    first to update the X4A.dat) and use X4A.dump to just update the
	    values.
