To make sure detector is perpendicular to the beam

1) move detector to the vertical_1 position and take a image

2) move detector to the vertical_2/3 position and take a image

3) find the distance and divde it to the length between the vertical_1 and vertical_2/3
   that is the pitch angle

4) make correction of this angle.

same way to make corrections on horizontal position

make sure to put the detector on the rotation axis of the yaw in order to make good corrections.

Also  make sure the beam is filtered very weak so that it will not damage the detector.
