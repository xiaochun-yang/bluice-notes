In SampleMountingDevice.itcl

function SampleMountingDevice::mountNextCrystal

1.	set screening_mode

2.	dismountCrystal 		 2.9sec  

3.	wait 				 0.5sec 

4.	remountCrystal 			 16.73sec (total including the following)
	
	a) move sample to mount position (0.1sec)
	b) change sample address 	 (0.48sec)
	c) mount crystal		 (16.14sec)


There's big wait (over 2sec) between dismount and remount. 
For check the timing for this, I did the follwoing

1) put the timer at the end of the UNMOUNT pac file

2) put the timer at the begining of the MOUNT pac file

This could tell time delayed between the executions from dismount to mount.
The result is ??
