In order to make the xiaSaturnDHS work, the following changes have been made.

(1) In file handelSrc/xerxes.c

Change variable *info to *Info because "info" is already defined in logging which library is
used in the compilation.

(2) Remove all the old files for both handelSrc ans src and recompile everything. 

(3) must change the permission to RW to the usb port. It's in /proc/bus/usb/
in my case it's in 001. /sbin/lsusb will list all the usb connections. check the
device 701 (xiaSaturn) and see which bus it's on. the change the mode on that device.
there might be a easier way to do it so that it only do it once. need to find it out.

(4) the data read from the xiaSaturn controller from excitation script
is for total 1024 channels. the index 1 is the percent of dead time.
i.e. set percentDeadTime [lindex $result 1]  the $result is the data.
excitation script automatically decide which channel is for the requested
energy.

(5) In *.dat add
