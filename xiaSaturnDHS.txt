In order to make the xiaSaturnDHS work, the following changes have been made.

(1) In file handelSrc/xerxes.c

Change variable *info to *Info because "info" is already defined in logging which library is
used in the compilation.

(2) Remove all the old files for both handelSrc ans src and recompile everything. 

(3) must change the permission to RW to the usb port. It's in /proc/bus/usb/
in my case it's in 001. /sbin/lsusb will list all the usb connections. check the
device 701 (xiaSaturn) and see which bus it's on. the change the mode to "rw" on that device.
there might be a easier way to do it so that it only do it once. need to find it out.

(3+) somehow it only work with the root as following
in root user
in ../xiaSaturnDhs/linux/
execute ./xiaSaturn X4A
******need to find out why"


changed /etc/rc.sysinit from
if [ ! -d /proc/bus/usb ]; then
        modprobe usbcore >/dev/null 2>&1 && mount -n -t usbfs /proc/bus/usb
/proc/bus/usb 
else
        mount -n -t usbfs /proc/bus/usb /proc/bus/usb 
fi

to
if [ ! -d /proc/bus/usb ]; then
        modprobe usbcore >/dev/null 2>&1 && mount -n -t usbfs /proc/bus/usb
/proc/bus/usb -o devgid=100,devmode=664
else
        mount -n -t usbfs /proc/bus/usb /proc/bus/usb -o
devgid=100,devmode=664
fi

SOOOOOOOOOLVED!!!!!!!
The /etc/rc.sysinit file change is the right thing to do in order to change
the permission.

I found the program stucked in "usb_set_configuration" function the usblib_linux.c
it suppose to return "0". But it always return "-1" except in the root
account. no matter what permission I change for the xiaSaturn device in the
/proc/bus/usb/....   I made small program called usb_test.c to test. It's the
same error. However when I keep the xiaSaturn cable connected and reboot the 
computer. Then it works on non root account. So that means the permissions I 
changed somehow was not effected even though it looks being changed. I tried 
unplug the usb cable and plug the cable back. It still work. 

Need a way to find how to restart the usb device without reboot the computer.















(4) the data read from the xiaSaturn controller from excitation script
is for total 1024 channels. the index 1 is the percent of dead time.
i.e. set percentDeadTime [lindex $result 1]  the $result is the data.
excitation script automatically decide which channel is for the requested
energy.

(5) In *.dat add
xiaSaturn

(6) saturn.ini should be in the ../linux64 directory (same as the executable
xiaSatuen)



(6) madScan in /dcss/scripts/operation
