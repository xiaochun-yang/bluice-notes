We have AMC servo driver failure

Symtom: 1) Feel little force when manually move phi by hand
	2) when home it. It become even force free.

Replace procedures
	1) install the DrivWare 7 software in a window PC
	2) connect the driver to computer through RS232 cable
	3) Run the program and "open" a project (saved in my laptop and office PC and USB portable disk)
	4) "connect" to the AMC driver.
	5) download the "backed up project"
	6) save it in the non changible memory"

	7) turn the motor power on
	8) at this time the motor may still feel little force when moved by hand
	9) Home it by command (galil "FI" command). 
	10) Now motor should be firm and you can feel it by hand.
