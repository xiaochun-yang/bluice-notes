The purpose for this part of codes is to add a warm up grabber feature
in the screening mode so that people can set after how many mount/dismount 
the robot should warm up the grabber in case it collects too much ice.

at the beging of the file 
set grabber-warm-index 0


in the SampleMountingDevice::mountNextCrystal function

#put after mountCrystal

global grabber-warm-index 
set grabber-warm-index [expr grabber-warm-index + 1]

if { $grabber-warm-index > $wash_cycle } {
	#warm the grabber
	start_operation warm_up_grabber
}
