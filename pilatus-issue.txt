(1) The exexution of ./run.tcl X4A will be hold if there's disk defined in the config (default)
lost connection or not being connected. This is due to the method "checkDiskSpace" in the
PilatusControl.tcl will check all the disk. so be careful on this. 

(2) The new DependencyInjector.tcl in DcsWidgets somehow is not working with 
the pilatus scrits. The old one is being used right now. Need to find out why.
Maybe a pilatus scripts are needed to be upgraded.

(3) the new SequenceDevice.tcl dosen't work. Still use the old one. need to
find out why.

(4) add the following in the dat file
