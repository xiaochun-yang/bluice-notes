the imperson server sometimes won't start because xinetd doesn't start.

Somehow xinetd won't start at the begining of the boot. I have to manually 
start it.

solution: making the xinetd start at the boot. Do the following:

1) to be the super
2) go to /etc/xinetd.d 
3) edit telnet and change "disable = yes" to "disable = no"

so this way, the xinet is being started by telnet at system startup
