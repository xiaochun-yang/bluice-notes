auto_adxv mode coding.

The XFORMSTATUSFILE is defined in the file /usr/local/ccd_dist/LOGIN_files/log_x4a_api_418 as the following

setenv  XFORMSTATUSFILE /usr/local/ccd_dist/tmp/xf_status

it being sourced in the .cshrc at login

In the file DiffImageViewer.tcl in the BluIceWidgets directory, The following code has been added for manupulate the file index and update current image file names.

#yangx add to same the filename to $XFORMSTATUSFILE for "adxv -automode"
   global env
   if [catch {open $env(XFORMSTATUSFILE)} fileID] {
        puts stderr "Cannot open $XFORMSTATUSFILE: $fileID"
   } else {
        set line [split [gets $fileID] " "]
        set imgNum [expr [lindex $line 0] + 1]
        close $fileID
        set fileID [open $env(XFORMSTATUSFILE) w+]
        puts $fileID "$imgNum $m_fileName"
        close $fileID
   }
}

In order to auto view the image user need to open a window first and them
input the command  at the prompt as follow:

>adxv -autoload

I did not make adxv in the auto mode in the bluice. Bluice still display the current
image. It's can be easily make bluice to auto desplay the image but for now just leave the way it's.
