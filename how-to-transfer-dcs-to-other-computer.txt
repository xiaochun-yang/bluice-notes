Here is the procedures to setup a dcs in a new computer

1) tar dcs in /usr/local

2) Copy /usr/local/dcs/imperson_cpp/linux/imperson.d to /usr/local/sbin/imperson.d

3) create file /etc/xinetd.d/imperson with the following content:
service imperson
{
	disable	= no
        type            =UNLISTED
        socket_type     =stream
        protocol        =tcp
        wait            =no
        user            =root
        server          =/usr/local/sbin/imperson.d
        server_args     =host=localhost port=8080 securePort=8443 appName=SMBTest caFile=/usr/local/dcs/dcsconfig/data/X4A.crt
        port            =61001
}

4) cd Authentication_Public/c
cp pam_authenticate /usr/local/sbin

5) cp Authentication/c/web-auth /etc/pam.d

6) search all the file with old hostname and relpace them with the new ones

7) change the host name, for example change "yangxc" to "xf19id1-w2"
use "hostname" command to see the local host name.

replace all the localhost name in the .config file and under tomcat directory and so on.
