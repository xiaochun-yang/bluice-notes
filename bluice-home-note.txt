In ..dhs/src. The following changes has been made for "homing" and a "script"

	move motorname to home
	move motorname to #script

(1) Add two messages in the dhs_messages.h

	 "DHS_MESSAGE_MOTOR_START_HOME" 	for homing	 
         "DHS_MESSAGE_MOTOR_START_SCRIPT"	for any script


(2) Add following lines in function of "stoh_start_motor_move" in "dhs_motor_messages.cc"
The script need to statrt with "#"

        if(strcmp(gToken[2], "home")==0)
        {
                MESSAGE_ID = DHS_MESSAGE_MOTOR_START_HOME;
                LOG_WARNING("yang before home messages sends over");
        }
        else if(gToken[2][0] == '#'){

                MESSAGE_ID = DHS_MESSAGE_MOTOR_START_SCRIPT;
                strcpy(message.script,gToken[2]);
                LOG_INFO1("message.script=%s \n", message.script);
                LOG_WARNING("yang galil script messages sends over");
        }

(3) Add two functions in_dmc2180.cc

	dmc2180_motor_start_home
	dmc2180_motor_start_script

In "dmc2180_motor_start_home" function, I only specify "home" is 0.0. It's better
if it include an offset. gToken[3] used as offset can be offset.

The "dmc2180_motor_start_script" is not well tested. 

(4) Add "start_home" function in Dmc2180API.cc

In this function, The home command used is specially for my case. It's not
generallized. It will need some work to make it for a general case. 




In ..dcss/src the following changes are made for handling "homing"

(1)   In gtos_start_motor_move function in the  dcss_gui_client.c file

	changed 
			 double newPosition;
	to 
			 char   newPosition[201];

	because "home" and "script" are not a double.



In ..DcsWidgets the following changes are made for "homing" button to work on the staff tab

(1)	In the Device.tcl file

	modefied
			 DCS::Motor::move 		function
			 DCS::RealMotor::move 		function

(2)
	In MotorControlPanel.tcl		

	Add Home button and handleHomeTo function
